# It's a chair

Here's an attempt at making a chair 1. out of wood 2. with some sort of lumbar support.

At this stage, it has not been built and might be complete trash.

Plans are available as PDF. The file [splines.pdf]() is at true scale, the file [splines-letter-filter.pdf]() splits it into letter-sized documents for printing on letter paper. Make sure your printer doesn't scale the document to fit the page to get true measurements.

The slats for the seat and the back have 8mm holes marked for dowel joints.
