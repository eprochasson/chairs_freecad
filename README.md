# It's a chair

Here's an attempt at making a chair 1. out of wood 2. with some sort of lumbar support.

Plans are available as PDF. The file [slat-curves.pdf](slat-curves.pdf) is at true scale and sliced into A4 and letter sized chunks for printing. Make sure your printer doesn't scale the document to fit the page to get true measurements.

The slats for the seat and the back have 8mm holes marked for dowel joints, you may want to adjust if you want to use something else.

# Comments after having built it

The back is quite upright and stiff, and the lumbar support pokes out quite a bit. That's how I like it, but it's not for everyone.

The sides of the chair I built are too thin (20mm). I updated the plans to make them 30mm. It is overall still quite sturdy, especially after I added 2 stretchers.

The glue-up of the slats was a major pain. I should have varnished the assembled sides and all the slats individually first, then glue them. After assembly, it's impossible to clean the glue in all the corners. As the actual bonding happens with the dowels and the holes (and it's easy to _not_ varnish those), it should not affect the structural integrity much, while making it easy to clean the cured glue on the visible, varnished parts.
